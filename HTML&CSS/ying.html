    <ul>
        <li>For the past 24 years, I have been living in Shanghai. As we all known, Shanghai is an international city. There are lots of foreigners and local people. I spent my childhood and middle school years in Shanghai. I have many friends and many memories, but now I find that the difference in thinking makes it difficult for me to communicate more with my friends, so it becomes less difficult to give up when I leave Shanghai. </li>
        <li>People in Shanghai are very busy. It usually takes an hour to commute to work from 9am to 5pm, so people leave early and return late at night. Work pressure is very high and I use my free time to find ways to relieve pressure, such as entertainment news, playing the slime, watching short videos. As a result, a vicious circle is formed, work creates pressure, and there is no time to improve myself after get off work hours to relieve pressure. I used to like literature and drama. After I went to work, I found that the whole person became very boring. I just watched some entertainment gossip and fragmented my time. It is difficult to concentrate on reading long articles and thinking more. So I have to change places and lifestyles.</li>
        <li>After I came to Finland, I was happy every day. It was happy to see the forest, to ride a bicycle, and to be greeted by drivers. I found that there are almost no large billboards in Finland, except for the bus stop signs made by children in k-market and s-market. I think it’s because Finns are not so stressed, so there is no need to decompress them. You can get satisfaction from books and series, so it won’t give birth to a huge entertainment industry. I think this is good. If you have more energy to pay attention to yourself, you won’t pay attention to entertainment stars. </li>
